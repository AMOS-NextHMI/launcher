# Present design:

|   App1   |   App2   |   App3   |

## displayed as:

individual activities that do not require any tampering of the apps themselves, must however be in package and declared in Manifest

## upon click:

App opens in full screen

## TODO: always-on-top button to return home

This will also hopefully give us more insight into how one could launch an app within our launcher without making it native to the launcher
